PROBLEM: Lack of attendance at Compa! workshops.

Causes:
- Lack of consistent communication.
- People have other commitments and jobs that conflict with the timing.
- People who might be interested don't know about it.
- Meetings aren't all that attractive, no food, they're long.
- People have a hard time getting to Peloton.
- Lack of coherent policy regarding attendance.
- People don't know what to expect from the classes.
- People don't know what's being asked of them.
- People don't know how to go about doing the suggested projects.
- There aren't special speakers and events that would draw people out.
- Organizers have limitted time and no compensation for keeping it going.
- Lack of strategic plan. People don't value it if they don't know what it's supposed to be.


Solutions:
- Call everybody on Sunday to check in about whether or not they're coming.
- Develop a policy about what's expected from participants.
- Draft a coherent vision of what these workshops \ Compa! are aiming for.
- List specific events and upcoming curriculum, so people can plan accordingly.
- Draft a strategic plan, so people can get excited about the mission.
- Track attendance, so we can check in on how people are doing.
- Come up with a certificate that can be given to people who participate in the workshop.
- Publicize Compa! workshops more publicly.
- Open the workshops up beyond the immigrant community.
