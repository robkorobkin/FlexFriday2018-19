<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- 

	WELCOME!

	This is a very simple HTML document.  

	Let's look at how it's set up!

	

	DOCTYPE
	========
	You see that line at the top starting with "<!DOCTYPE..."?
	That tells the browser that it's looking at HTML and should render it as a webpage instead of just outputting it line by line.



	WELCOME TO HTML NODES \ ELEMENTS
	===================================
	Everything in HTML is divided into "nodes" - also called "HTML elements"
	~~
	<node>
		<child_node></child_node>
		<sibling_node></sibling_node>
	</node>

	We describe the relationships between nodes using the terms "parent", "child" and "sibling"

	

	Nodes also contain attributes, like this:
	~~
	<node attribute="value"></node>


	And a body, like this:
	~~
	<node> afdkljasdfljkasdf;l </node>


	COMMENTS
	========================================
	The only things in HTML that are not elements are comments.
	They look like this: <!- - COMMENT - ->
	Everything between the <!- and the -> of a comment is ignored when the HTML is "parsed"




	<HTML>
	========================================
	The outermost element is the <html> node.  
	It has a language attribute, which is set here to "en" for Engish.
	This informs the browser that it's rendering the page in English.

<html lang="en">
	
	<!--
			
		<head>
		=========
		The first child element within the <html> element is the <head> element.

		The body of this element contains information and links to additional files that 
		are necessary for the page to render but are not part of the page content itself.

		For example, the title of the page, which appears at the top of your browser,
		is included in the <head> using the <title> element.

	-->

	<head>

		<title>HTML is fun!</title>

	</head>



	<!-- 
		<body>
		===========
		Then we have the <body> element, which is where the actual page content goes

		Let's look at some different kinds of elements within the body...
	-->

	<body>
	
		<!--		

			TEXT
			======
			Most styles are applied to text using an approach called CSS, which we'll get into later.
			For now, just notice that the text appears differently when contained within different kinds of nodes.

		-->
		<h1>Title</h1>
		<p>Paragraph.</p>
		<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do <i>eiusmod</i> tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. <b>Duis</b> aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

		<h2>H2</h2>
		<h3>H3</h3>
		<h4>H4</h4>
		<h5>H5</h5>



		<!-- 
			IMAGE 
			=======
			Images are conveyed using <img> nodes with the url of the image as the value of the node's "src" attribute.
			Try finding an image online and editing this page to display it.
		-->
		<img src="https://s0.2mdn.net/ads/richmedia/studio/41440126/28384_20160216075434187_Compete_Child_728x90.jpg" />


		<!-- 
			LINE BREAKS
			=======
			Want a new line?  Just add a <br />
		-->
		<br />



		<!-- 
			LINKS
			=======
			Links are conveyed using <a> nodes with the target url as the value of the "href" attribute.
			The body of the node will now be hyperlinked to bring the user to the new page when clicked.
		-->
		<a href="http://www.google.com">LINK</a>



		<!--
			LISTS
			======
			Notice the difference between an ordered list <ol> and an unordered list <ul>.
		-->
		<ul>
			<li>item 1</li>
			<li>item 2</li>
			<li>item 3</li>
		</ul>
		<ol>
			<li>item 1</li>
			<li>item 2</li>
			<li>item 3</li>
		</ol>



		<!-- 
			HORIZONTAL RULE
			=======
			Want a line across the window, just add a <hr />
		-->
		<hr />



		<!--
			TABLES
			=======
			This is an HTML table.
		-->
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
					pear
				</td>
				<td>
					bananananana
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					bananananana
				</td>
				<td>
					pear
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>


		<!-- 
			STYLING HTML
			=============
			There are two ways to "style" html.
			One way is to use the style attribute, like this:

		 -->
		 <p style="	color: blue; 
			 		font-size: x-large; 
			 		font-style: italic;">Look, I'm blue!</p>


		 <!-- 
		 	CSS
		 	===
		 	The other way is to add a "class" attribute, and then 
		 	write a rule defining how elements of that class
		 	should look.
		 -->
		<p class="redText">Look, I'm red!</p>
		<p class="redText">So am I!</p>
		<style>
			.redText { color: red;  }
		</style>
