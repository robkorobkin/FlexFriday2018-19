THE DOM
========
We're about to start the Document Object Model (the "DOM").

- In programming, objects are collections of information. 
	- Each piece of information is called a "property" of the object
	- Objects also contain actions that can be done with the information in the object, each of which is called a "method" of the object.


For example, think about a chair.
